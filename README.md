## About the app
The app will monitorize the heating water network problems from Bucharest and it will create a heatmap with the the problems over the year.

The application will help a lot of people that want to move (or rent) a flat/house in Bucharest (showing them how frequent is the heating problem in the neighborhood they want to move).

The data is provided using the CMTEB website and the API that I have built to retrieve the necessary infos from their website.

The heatmap is created in the back-end using Python and showed in the mobile app (front-end).
